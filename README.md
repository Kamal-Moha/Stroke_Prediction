# Stroke_Prediction
This project predicts whether someone will have a stroke or not



My final model with the best results is the KNeighbors(KNN) model

This model has the highest recall. It has a recall of 1.00 for the positive class(stroke = 1) meaning its amazing
at detecting occurrence of stroke in a person.

It also has an f1 score of 0.97 which is really good as that shows balance between recall & precision in our data.

This KNN model also has a very high AUC & Accuracy scores of 0.97 which indicate that our model is generally performing well.

Yes my model will be useful in production and will make correct predictions using a balanced dataset.

Balance in our target vector is very important in the dataset as that limits bias & improves results.
